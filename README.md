## **US rental market analysis using ZORI index data**  


This project automates the analysis of Zillow's ZORI data to identify rental market stability and growth trends across the US from 2021-2025. The data pipeline, triggered by manual file uploads to S3, uses AWS Glue for ETL, Athena for SQL analytics, and Grafana for visualization, providing insights into market volatility and regional rental growth.

ZORI Index:
The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) is calculated to show how typical rents are changing over time in a specific area, like a city or metro region.
ZORI is like a rent thermometer for a city, showing whether rents are heating up or cooling down, based on how much the same homesâ€™ rents are changing from one rental to the next. This method helps give a clearer, less biased picture of real rent trends.

About the dataset:
This data is taken from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ website where Zillow update this data every 16th of each month. I downloaded and loaded csv manually into s3 bucket.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

## **Data Ingestion**
**1.S3 Bucket structure**

The **Zillow_data_input** S3 bucket is organized into three main subfolders to support efficient data processing and tracking:

**Unprocess_file:**
This folder stores all newly uploaded files that have not yet been processed. It serves as the initial landing zone for raw data.

**Transformed_data:**
After a file is picked up by an AWS Glue job, it is transformed and partitioned. The resulting processed files are saved in this folder, ready for downstream analytics.

**Process_file:**
Once a raw file has been successfully processed and cataloged by the AWS Glue Crawler, it is moved to this folder for archival purposes. This helps maintain a clear record of all files that have completed the ETL and cataloging process.

This folder structure ensures clear separation between raw, processed, and archived data, enabling robust data management and traceability throughout the pipeline.
